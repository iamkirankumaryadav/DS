**Data Structures**: Way to store and organize the data so that it can be accessed effectively.

### Why data structures are important?

1. Data structure is the basic and most important concept of every programming language.
2. It allows us to store the data in such a way that it can be retrieved very quickly and effectively.
3. Organizing the data is very important, when the data is kept in an organized form we can access the data easily.
4. e.g. Dictionary: The contents are organized alphabetically which helps us to find the words easily.
5. Data is organized in different ways based on needs and ease of accessing and updating it.

Built In | User Defined
:--- | :---
List | Stack
Tuple | Queue
Set | Linked List
Dictionary | Tree
_ | Graph

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Built In</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan=5>Dictionary</td>
    <td>Data = {"Name": "Kirankumar Yadav", "City": "Bangalore"}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>   
    <td>We can also create dictionaries using the <code>dict()</code> constructor</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Keys must be immutable, values can be mutable or immutable.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Keys must be unique, duplicate keys will be removed automatically.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dictionaries are unordered, we cannot access values using an index, we access using keys.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

    <th>Built In</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan=7>Set</td>
    <td>Data = {1, 2, 3, 4}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>   
    <td>We can create sets using the <code>set()</code> constructor</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Collection of unique elements.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data type of an empty set i.e. {} is dictionary. Use <code>set()</code> constructor to create an empty set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sets are unordered, we can't access values using an index. We can apply loops over sets.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sets are mutable, but we can only add() or remove() new elements</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sets can't be nested, the elements must be immutable</td>
  </tr>
