**Data Structures**: Way to store and organize the data so that it can be accessed effectively.

### Why data structures are important?

1. Data structure is the basic and most important concept of every programming language.
2. It allows us to store the data in such a way that it can be retrieved very quickly and effectively.
3. Organizing the data is very important, when the data is kept in an organized form we can access the data easily.
4. e.g. Dictionary: The contents are organized alphabetically which helps us to find the words easily.
5. Data is organized in different ways based on needs and ease of accessing and updating it.
